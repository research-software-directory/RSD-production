This repository contains the necessary scripts and information needed to run an RSD in production

## Database migration
When upgrading to a new release, the database structure might change. See the `database-migration` directory for instructions.

Starting from release 1.2.2, we also provide the necessary scripts that allow you to update the database between a release and its immediate predecessor (see the `migration-scripts` directory).
