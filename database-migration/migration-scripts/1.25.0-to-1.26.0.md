# Upgrading to Postgres 15.3

This release upgrades the database from Postgres 14.2 to 15.3. Apply the following steps to upgrade your instance:

First stop the NGINX and scrapers containers so that the content of the database will not change anymore:

```bash
docker-compose stop nginx scrapers
```

Make a backup of the data:

```bash
docker-compose exec database pg_dump --format=tar --file=rsd-backup.tar --username=rsd --dbname=rsd-db
```

Copy it over from the container to the local file system:

```bash
docker cp database:rsd-backup.tar rsd-backup.tar
```

Now remove all the containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Remove the database volume (use `docker volume ls` if your volume is named differently):

```bash
docker volume rm ubuntu_pgdb
```

Now download the new release, *don't* unpack the `nginx.conf` file:

```bash
curl --location --output release.zip https://github.com/research-software-directory/RSD-as-a-service/releases/download/v1.26.0/deployment.zip && unzip release.zip
```
Start the new database:

```bash
docker-compose up --detach database
```

Copy the backup to the container:

```bash
docker cp rsd-backup.tar database:rsd-backup.tar
```

Restore the backup:

```bash
docker-compose exec database pg_restore --username=rsd --dbname=rsd-db --clean rsd-backup.tar
```

Now start the other services:

```bash
docker-compose up --detach
```
